Thanks to Eduardo GÃ³mez who contributed [Map Generator Sketch Plugin](https://github.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator).
It's not so easy to access Google Maps in c h n for someone. So I develop this plugin with BaiduMap and Mapbox, and make it easy to extend for other map services.

## Installation

- [Download](https://codeload.github.com/terence55/sketch-map-creator/zip/1.0.0) and unzip.

## Usage
