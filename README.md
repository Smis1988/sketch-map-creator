Thanks to Eduardo GÃ³mez who contributed [Map Generator Sketch Plugin](https://github.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator).
It's not so easy to access Google Maps in c h n for someone. So I develop this plugin with BaiduMap and Mapbox, and make it easy to extend for other map services.

## Installation

- [Download](https://github.com/terence55/sketch-map-creator/archive/v1.0.0.zip) and unzip.
- Open the file 'MapCreator.sketchplugin' for auto installation.
    
## Usage

- Select a shape layer.
- Choose the map you need.
- Enter custom options.
- Done.
